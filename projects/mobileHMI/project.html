<h2 id="toc_1">Background</h2>

<p>This is a project I worked on as a Usability Engineer at ICONICS, an industrial automation software company. I worked together with the Director of Global Marketing, Product Manager, and others on the marketing team to create a demo mobile human machine interface application for various roles in the water industry. </p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Team Approach</h2>

<p>From individual interviews with water company executives, we identified target users, gatherered user requirements, and collected detailed information regarding facility operations, equipment, key performance indices and other metrics. </p>

<p>We then used the information collected to analyze how tasks were currently being performed by various roles in the industry, determine when interactions between roles were needed, and how the mobile app could improve the efficiency and experience of these workflows. The common and distinct elements among role-based dashboards and displays were then defined by outlining specific use cases and needs the application must support for each user.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">My Role</h2>

<ul>
<li>Facilitated all user research activities</li>
<li>Designed mockups and high-fidelity prototypes for the role of an operator in the water industry from a detailed outline of user needs for five key use cases</li>
<li>Collaboratively designed a consistent look and feel across role-based dashboards</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_4">A Mobile Application for Joan, the Operator</h2>

<p>I designed the operator's dashboard to allow for easy, remote collaboration with managers and field service technicians in order to efficiently respond to utility customer complaints and time-sensitive, critical events. In particular, her dashboard was designed to support five key use cases.</p>

<h3 id="toc_5">Use Case 1</h3>

<h4 id="toc_6">Monitor active items with real time contextual information</h4>

<p>For responding to customer complaints and emergency situations, the Metering Area display was designed to make it easy for Joan to see real-time contextual information relevant to the event. Map filters allow layers of information to be shown or hidden, and provide a detailed list with the status of each alarm and complaint currently active. From this screen, Joan can add a new customer complaint.</p>

<h3 id="toc_7">Use Case 2</h3>

<h4 id="toc_8">Add active item and assign the task to available technician</h4>

<p>A form is provided to add the complaint and assign the task to a field service technician. Once alerted via SMS text or e-mail, the new complaint is also added to the technicianâ€™s list of active items. For guiding first time users through the app, a pop up with instructions to select the first name under Assign Task brings the user directly to the field services view to see how this task is added in their dashboard. </p>

<h3 id="toc_9">Use Case 3</h3>

<h4 id="toc_10">Monitor raw water</h4>

<p>For monitoring the status of raw water pumps and tanks, Joan needs both current and recent historical measurements. This display was designed to make comparing measurements and identifying trends intuitive by using timelines that consistently place the current status to the far right. Information was grouped by equipment and ordered from top to bottom by the direction of water flow.</p>

<h3 id="toc_11">Use Case 4</h3>

<h4 id="toc_12">Monitor water treatment</h4>

<p>This display illustrates various ways key water metrics for Joan could be visualized, making it easier to identify the presence of potentially harmful chemicals, and keep track of stored supplies for treatment. For instance, stored treatment chemical levels could be indicated with circular bars, whereas a stacked bar chart could be used to show more detailed current and historical records for the probable makeup of harmful chemicals detected.</p>

<h3 id="toc_13">Use Case 5</h3>

<h4 id="toc_14">Monitor sludge handling operations</h4>

<p>The sludge handling display is an example of how the mobile HMI can allow for direct remote control over equipment. It also was designed to show how related metrics can be incorporated to assist operators like Joan in data-driven decision making. For instance, below the pump statuses and controls is a chart of recent historical pump activity and the resulting electricity costs.</p>

<h2 id="toc_15">Reflection</h2>

<p>In working on a small team alongside the Product Manager and Director of Global Marketing, I was very cognizant of the technical and business requirements from the start of the project and learned the value in balancing these requirements with user needs while designing the demo app. Being the only UX member on the team, I did <i>a lot</i> of research to help guide and defend my design decisions and learned <i>a lot</i> in the process.</p>
